If you can, avoid try catch by writing good code.

add line 
 debugger;
  to freeze the code at the line to evaluate the elements values at that stage. and open the debugger tag in dev tools.

export function xyz(){...
  const data = localStorage.getItem('asdfasdfas')
 " if(!data) return [];"
  return JSON.parse(data); 
...}
This has "if()return.." Guard Clause. We can use Guard Clauses to keep our application from crashing and its behavior predictable.
